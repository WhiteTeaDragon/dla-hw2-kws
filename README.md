Model checkpoints are situated in the "trained models" folder of the repository. Inside of the notebook all needed checkpoints are downloaded in the code: the teacher model is downloaded in training part of each setup, and the trained model is downloaded in profiling model of each setup.

Also, for comparing different results one needs to have a fixed split on train and validation sets. This split is downloaded in the section "Data/Using fixed split" of the notebook and is present in the repository as well.
